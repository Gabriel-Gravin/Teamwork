**10.03.2023: Basic Plan**  
by Gabriel Gravin, Katelyn Gelle, Daisy Zhang, and Kaden Vo

# Player

- Character that moves up the screen and can move left and right.
- Goal is to get as high as possible.

# Background

- Background will move up with the player.
- Add different backgrounds as the player gets higher.

# Platform

- Random platforms the player jumps on.
- Walls to keep the player within the screen.

# Monsters

- Monsters that the player has to either kill or get around.  

**10.04.2023: Updated Plan**  

# Player  

- We will be using a spritesheet of Link from The Legend of Zelda.

# Background  

- We will be using a medieval-themed stone wall.
- We are contemplating having different backgrounds as the player progress, gradually increasing the game's difficult. However, this may be difficult to incorporate, so it's just a concept.  

# Monsters  

- Wizards  
- Goblins  
- Werewolves

**10.06.2023: Plans**

- Player: Link; may or may not be able to attack
- Other sprites: wizard, other monsters
- We need an HP bar!!!!
- UNLESS we want to take it out and just have the goblin do normal damage, and any attack hitting the player will kill them
- Background: medieval-style wall (vertical), may or may not change depending on the increasing difficulty. Ends at some point(?) Moves up with the player
- Also, we’ll put a high-score input, and maybe a score that keeps changing the higher the player jumps
Could make the score change depending on how every x amount of pixels you go up you gain more “score” 
- Platform: randomly generated within the walls, but always possible to get to the next one. Wooden? Stone?
- Home Screen: Have a start button in order for the game to begin. Also have the latest high score you need to try to beat.
- Other info: game will be based off the mobile game doodle jump combined with Zelda
- Plot: Link has to get to the top of the castle to save Zelda by fighting off Ganon’s minions. 
-  Link goes up the castle by jumping up the platforms in the castle 
- fights off the minions either by some type of attack input/animation or by jumping on their heads like in mario 

- Monsters: (spritesheets already found) We can manipulate their AI so they always target the player without really caring about their own survival. So they can just run off the platform and die (except the wizard, who will stay in the same place and just shoot things at the player.)
- Wizard: ranged damage
- Goblin: most damage
- Werewolf: fastest attacker

**10.10.2023: brainstorming/new ideas/extras:** 
- Make some minigames relating to our game 
- Flappy bird concept
- Rythm game concept where you could press a button at the right time to make Link do a flip on a trampoline
- Have two seperate options(maybe on the home screen) of "campaign/storymode" and "infinite" 
- storymode can show the player how to play while also creating a story out of it ; example: Ganon kidnaps Zelda and goes to the top of the tower, and Link has to jump his way up the tower to rescue her. 
- infinite could be a infinite game, where it'll go forever while you get a score for how far your able to go up and you can have some sort of local or cloud based leaderboard 
- difficulty could also increase the more you go up ; examples: bottom of the game goes "up" faster making it harder to catch up, monster spawnrate or maybe damage (if we add a hp/damage system) could change, spawnrate of breaking platforms could also change
