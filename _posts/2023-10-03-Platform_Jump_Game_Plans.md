**10.03.2023: Basic Plan**  
by Gabriel Gravin, Katelyn Gelle, Daisy Zhang, and Kaden Vo

# Player

- Character that moves up the screen and can move left and right.
- Goal is to get as high as possible.

# Background

- Background will move up with the player.
- Add different backgrounds as the player gets higher.

# Platform

- Random platforms the player jumps on.
- Walls to keep the player within the screen.

# Monsters

- Monsters that the player has to either kill or get around.  

**10.04.2023: Updated Plan**  

# Player  

- We will be using a spritesheet of Link from The Legend of Zelda.

# Background  

- We will be using a medieval-themed stone wall.
- We are contemplating having different backgrounds as the player progress, gradually increasing the game's difficult. However, this may be difficult to incorporate, so it's just a concept.  

# Monsters  

- Wizards  
- Goblins  
- Wolves
