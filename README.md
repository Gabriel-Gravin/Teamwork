## Unit 1  

This page displays our progress as a group for the Unit 1 section. We worked together to study up on how to create calculators using JavaScript.  

## Unit 2  

This page displays our work for creating Teamwork, our group project. We implemented different tools and mechanisms, with all of us taking on separate roles that would eventually become the final product. We first experimented with different sprites so that we could figure out a sort of recipe for how our sprite's animations would work. After we had created our original background and had successfully rendered our final sprite, Link, into a draft background with his own physics, we were able to combine this into the final jumping game. In addition, we were also able to code different minigames: for example, the Tic-Tac-Toe and Number Guesser. Working on these projects helped us to work better as a team while also giving us firsthand experience in coding. Overall, these endeavors involved a lot of collaboration and trial-and-error.
